# GameAI

This repository contains implementations of AI agents for **Chess** and **Connect 4** integrated into a multi-page React application. The Chess AI uses alpha-beta pruning combined with the minimax algorithm, while the Connect 4 AI leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for strategic decision-making.

## Overview
GameAI is designed to showcase AI capabilities in popular strategy games, implementing algorithms suited to each game's unique dynamics.

### Technologies
- **React** (multiple pages)
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning & Minimax** for Chess AI
- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** for Connect 4 AI

## Chess AI
The Chess AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize move selection efficiently, improving decision-making by pruning unnecessary branches in the search tree.

## Connect 4 AI
The Connect 4 AI relies on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a method that evaluates potential moves by running numerous simulated games, allowing the AI to make statistically advantageous moves.

## React Implementation
This project is implemented as a multi-page React application. Each game has a dedicated page, providing a tailored UI and interaction experience for each game.
